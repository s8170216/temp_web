          <h3>Unji on the top of owl rock</h3>
          <p>He was reborned as the Legend of Rapper after "unjing" on the owl stone on March 23th, 2009.
            Because he was implicated in the bribe scandal.
            And now, the word "unji" is nominalized as a proper noun, and it's registered in the oxford dictionary.</p>

          <h3>Plagiarism issues</h3>
          <p>One of the world class famous rapper Eminem was also stirred up the controversy with him.
            As he tried to imitate MC Muhyun, such as wearing Roh muhyun T-shirt, and plagiarizing he's track, 'shame yourself'.
            MC Muhyun :"Without firm faith or any confidence, Eminem goes back and forth in his narrow status."
            "That makes me upset. I did my best at any moment since I was resurrected as MC Muhyun in ilbe, after broken my head.“
            “i always composed my rap lyric, rewarding Ilgay continuously reviving me."
            "I don't get mad at the plagiarism. I'm really angry about Eminem himself."</p>

          <img class="works_image" src="images/nomaru.jpg" alt="새활동">
          <h3>New Albums</h3>
          <p>But recently, MC Muhyun released new album, the Dream of Unji, and Nomaru Chan Opening Theme.
            So controversy is likely to be prolonged like, "MC Muhyun forget what first brought him into hardcore rapper." 
            or "He is not the legend anymore."</p>
